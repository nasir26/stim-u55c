// Deliberately at global scope, not inside namespace stim_u55c (unlike
// everything else in kernel/): Vitis HLS's C/RTL cosimulation generates
// a top-level "hw_stub" wrapper keyed off the top function's linkage,
// and a namespace-qualified top function tripped that up (the testbench
// build failed to link against `stim_frame_sampler_hw_stub` even though
// csynth itself was unaffected). This is the one function in kernel/
// that v++ actually instantiates as the kernel, so it's also the one
// with a reason to deviate from the namespace the rest of the kernel
// uses -- see stim_frame_sampler.cpp. ap_uint<N> resolves here in both
// real-ap_int.h and shim builds -- see ap_uint.hpp.
// `layer_offsets` has num_layers+1 entries (kernel/isa.py:Program.layer_offsets):
// layer L is instructions[layer_offsets[L] .. layer_offsets[L+1]). Every
// instruction within a layer is guaranteed qubit-disjoint from every
// other instruction in that same layer (kernel/isa.py:_layer_and_reorder)
// -- see stim_frame_sampler.cpp for what that guarantee is (and isn't)
// used for.
